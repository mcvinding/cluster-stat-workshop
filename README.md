# NatMEG Workshop: Non-Parametric Cluster-Based Permutation Tests for Analysing Neural Time-Series

Here you find the tutorial and material for the doctoral workshop *Non-Parametric Cluster-Based Permutation Tests for Analysing Neural Time-Series* hosted at NatMEG (www.natmeg.se) at Karolinska Institutet.

## Tutorial overview

The tutorial presents one example of how to analyse MEG/EEG signals with non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests. The tutorial is an educational demonstration and is not meant as an exhaustive account of how to analyse MEG/EEG data. The material is design to give an overview and useable example code on how to do the analysis. If you want to apply similar principles to analyse your own data please apply the methods as is appropriate.

To begin with the tutorial click on `tutorial.md` above. Read the text of the tutorial and execute the example code in your MATLAB terminal or copy/pate it into a script of your own.

It is recommended that you take the time to play around with the code and explore what is in the input and output structures that you will create during the tutorial to get the most out of it.

## Requirements

To run the tutorial you need MATLAB (www.mathworks.com) and  FieldTrip (www.fieldtriptoolbax.org). You can download FieldTrip for free from their webpage  or get the code directly from GitHub (https://github.com/fieldtrip).

Basic programming skills (preferably in MATLAB) are necessary to do the tutorial, but you are welcome to try matter your skill level. It is not required that you know FieldTrip in advance to do the tutorial, but familiarity with the general logic and use of FieldTrip is recommended. To learn more about FieldTrip, we recommend looking at the FieldTrip webpage for documentation and many more tutorial examples.

The goal of the tutorial is not to teach MATLAB or FieldTrip per se, but will use FieldTrip as a tool to demonstrate cluster-based permutation tests.
